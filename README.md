Inspired by the duotone effect employed in the [*Twotone*](https://audiotheme.com/view/twotone/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=link&utm_content=twotonefx-readme&utm_campaign=plugins) theme, <em>Twotone FX</em> makes it easy to preview and apply a similar filter to any photo in your Media Library.
